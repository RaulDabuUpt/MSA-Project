# Idle Run


In this mobile idle game for Android, players control a character that continuously runs through an endless path, automatically collecting coins as time passes. The gameplay is passive, allowing the character to gather resources even when the app is closed. Coins collected can be used to upgrade the characterâ€™s speed, abilities, or unlock new characters and environments. The game includes various power-ups, such as items to increase coin value or boosts for faster progression. Occasional obstacles and challenges add variety, but the primary goal is to accumulate wealth and upgrades over time without constant player input.
