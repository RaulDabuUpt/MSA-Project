# CoGame, a collection of games


CoGame offers a collection of diverse mini-games, tailored to different genres and playstyles. A built-in recommendation system suggests new games based on the tags and categories of those you've previously played. As users explore various games—ranging from puzzles and action to strategy and trivia—the app tracks their preferences, using tags like “fast-paced,” “logic,” or “shooter” to refine suggestions. Players can easily discover new games that match their interests, making the experience more personalized over time.
