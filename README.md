# CoGame, a collection of games

## Overview

**CoGame** features a diverse collection of mini-games, designed to suit a variety of genres and playstyles. It includes a built-in recommendation system that suggests new games based on the tags and categories of the games you've previously played.

As you explore different types of games—such as puzzles, action, strategy, or trivia—the app tracks your preferences using tags like “fast-paced,” “logic,” or “shooter.” Over time, the app refines its suggestions, helping you discover new games that align with your interests. The more you play, the more personalized your gaming experience becomes.
